# WorldCupScoreboard

Task requirements:
You are working in a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live Football
World Cup Scoreboard library that shows all the ongoing matches and their scores.

The scoreboard supports the following operations:

1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
a. Home team
b. Away team

2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score.

3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.

4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the
scoreboard.


For example, if following matches are started in the specified order and their scores
respectively updated:
a. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
b. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
c. Germany 2 - France 2
d. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
e. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
The summary should be as follows:
1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
3. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
4. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
5. Germany 2 - France 2


There are two libraries WorldCupScoreboard and WorldCupScoreboard.Test

WorldCupScoreboard contains the implementation, the validation of the requiments

Class FootballScoreboardService implements this interface

 public interface IFootballScoreboardService
 {
     public void StartMatch(Team homeTeam, Team awayTeam);

     public IEnumerable<Match> GetMatchesInProgress();

     public void UpdateScore(MatchUpdateInfo matchUpdateInfo);

     public void FinishMatch(MatchUpdateInfo matchUpdateInfo);
 }
 
 All imput validation was done in the separete services by using FluentValidator.
